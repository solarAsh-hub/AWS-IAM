# AWS - Identity Access Management 

Overviewing the need for Identity and Access Management (IAM) on AWS
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) is critical for securing resources in any cloud environment, including Amazon Web Services (AWS). It ensures that the right individuals and systems have access to the appropriate resources at the correct levels of privilege, while also preventing unauthorized access. AWS IAM provides a scalable, flexible, and secure way to manage access across AWS services.

## This project we will be focusing on the four main constructs

1. Users and Groups

ðŸ“ŒCreate individual user accounts or groups to manage permissions collectively.

3. Policies

ðŸ“ŒUse JSON-based documents to define permissions.

ðŸ“ŒTypes: AWS-managed policies, customer-managed policies, and inline policies.

5. Roles

ðŸ“ŒAssign permissions to applications, services, or users without sharing credentials.
Often used for granting temporary access.
